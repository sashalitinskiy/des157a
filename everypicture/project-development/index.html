    <h2> Project Development: Design Iteration </h2>
    
    <p>
        My best friend Samantha sends me a letter every week and on each envelope she creates her own wax seal. I will recreate this photo and have it be a picture of my desk and have the letters strewn around on my desk. The wax seals will be hoverable buttons on top of the envelopes. When you hover over the wax seal - you will stamp the seal with a beautiful “S” for Samantha. I want to set up my desk with all my knick knacks to paint an even more vivid picture of my life and set the scene of where I open my letters. </p>

    <p>I think this change improves the project by making it more personal in that this is where I open the letters. I give the reader more context by showing them another layer of the project. I do not have images as of now of my desk, but am planning on taking them tonight. Another change I plan to make is adding a little illustration in the overlays that will pop up once you click a wax seal. I think adding a little more context makes for a more cohesive and memorable user experience. </p>
