        I enjoyed reading this article about best practices for form design. Although I’ve heard about some of the things in the article, I learned a lot of things that seem small, but greatly affect the overall user experience for the person on the site/app. I also learned that things that may seem to apply to the overall design rules that you learn may not actually be best practice. Such as number 1 in the list: minimizing input fields. Although it may seem to make more sense to make the form sizes uniform, it may not be the most logical thing for the user to see. 

Another thing that I found interesting was the advice to ask the easy questions first and the hard questions last. In my mind, I would rather get the difficult stuff over first. But it is completely different when a user does things online. When they gave the example of entering credit card info first v last, I realized how true this was. A user is much more likely to be committed to some action if they are drawn in with the easier tasks first. 


A  website that I consider to have mastered these best practices is the Airbnb website. Booking a rental home is a difficult, big task, that comes with 10s of smaller subtasks. The Airbnb website knows this and makes it so that everything is very purposeful. It is made with the user not only in mind, but in the center of design and usability. Doing something very stressful is made smooth and even exciting by the way that the website is designed. Every inch on the screen serves a purpose.

<p>This article talked about the best practices for overlays/modals/dialogs. First off, I'll give the definition of a modal window. A modal is something that is on top of the application's main window, disabling the parent content. It makes the UI simpler while saving space on screen. It is commonly used when designers need to capture a user's full attention by interrupting their current task. Other use cases include collecting input and displaying additional information. Their overuse has made them seem frustrating as pop-ups. This leads to users dismissing them, I often do the same! A best practice includes showing a clear exit option such as a close button, escape key, etc. Another is using actionable button labels. A third is using good sizing to avoid overwhelming the entire screen. What I found the article was saying is that, most importantly, accessibility is the main focus. Modals should enhance the user experience, not take it away. </p>

<p>The Maná Yerba Mate website is a really cool and immersive experience that uses bold imagery and smooth interactions to create a strong sensory connection with the product. The product is the Mana Yerba Mate. The full-screen photographs of yerba mate leaves, warm tones, and elegant typography establish a natural, close to earth feel. The site relies on parallax scrolling, subtle animations, and layered visuals to make navigation dynamic. There was a strong reliance on images rather than text. 
    While the design is very sleek however, functionality takes a hit. Some pages take longer to load due to the high-resolution images, and navigation isn’t always intuitive—it can be unclear where to click next. I found myself feeling frustrated at how I was supposed to navigate, I personally didn’t like there being only one way I could scroll that was unpredictable. I prefer predictable pages. 
    There was also a game that you play at the bottom of the page - similar to the dinosaur game when you do not have wifi. It felt a little too much - although cute. It felt too far removed from the point of the site. I was playing and was so entranced by the visuals I thought “what is this site again?”. Something that I think a successful site should not have me saying. 
    What I appreciated about this site though was instead of just listing facts about yerba mate, it crafts an atmosphere that evokes warmth and craftsmanship. The site feels more like a visual journey than an online store, which is both its greatest weakness and strength. Overall, it’s an engaging and fun site that could benefit from clearer navigation.
