        I enjoyed reading this article about best practices for form design. Although Iâ€™ve heard about some of the things in the article, I learned a lot of things that seem small, but greatly affect the overall user experience for the person on the site/app. I also learned that things that may seem to apply to the overall design rules that you learn may not actually be best practice. Such as number 1 in the list: minimizing input fields. Although it may seem to make more sense to make the form sizes uniform, it may not be the most logical thing for the user to see. 

Another thing that I found interesting was the advice to ask the easy questions first and the hard questions last. In my mind, I would rather get the difficult stuff over first. But it is completely different when a user does things online. When they gave the example of entering credit card info first v last, I realized how true this was. A user is much more likely to be committed to some action if they are drawn in with the easier tasks first. 


A  website that I consider to have mastered these best practices is the Airbnb website. Booking a rental home is a difficult, big task, that comes with 10s of smaller subtasks. The Airbnb website knows this and makes it so that everything is very purposeful. It is made with the user not only in mind, but in the center of design and usability. Doing something very stressful is made smooth and even exciting by the way that the website is designed. Every inch on the screen serves a purpose.
